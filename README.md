<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>

Given a dataset of credit card transactions, the goal is to develop a model that can 
accurately identify and classify fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. The model 
should be able to handle large and complex data, and must have high accuracy, 
precision, and recall. Additionally, it should be computationally efficient and able to 
make predictions in real-time. The model should be able to handle imbalanced data, and 
should be robust enough to adapt to different types of frauds as they evolve. It is also 
important to consider the interpretability of the model so that it can be explained to 
business stakeholders.
